# Acquisition Royale

[Acquisition Royale](https://acquisitionroyale.com/) is a play-to-earn battle royale game on Polygon themed around mergers and acquisitions.

In Acquisition Royale, the goal is to ensure that your **Enterprise** (NFT) survives and thrives.

After founding your Enterprise, you'll automatically earn **Runway Points (RP)** over time, which can be used to compete against and acquire other Enterprises, or protect your own Enterprise from acquisition.

By strategically merging with and acquiring other Enterprises, you’ll earn RP at an even faster rate, setting you on the path towards **corporate domination**.

The game is developed by [**prePO**](https://prepo.io/) — an upcoming decentralized trading platform allowing anyone to gain exposure to any pre-IPO company or pre-token crypto project.
