# RP Shop

- Spend RP (from your wallet, not your Enterprise) to buy Enterprises or Consumables (Rename/Rebrand/Revive Tokens), all while supplies last.
- If your Enterprise has an RP balance but you donâ€™t have enough RP in your wallet, you need to Withdraw RP from your Enterprise first (or buy RP from secondary markets).
- RP Shop prices will increase as the game progresses.
