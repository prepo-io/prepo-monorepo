# Immunity

- An Enterprise will gain immunity after any merge, acquire or revive/founding action.
- If an Enterprise has immunity, it cannot be competed against and it cannot be acquired.
- Immunity does not stack i.e. any new immunity received will override any existing immunity, even if the new immunity period is shorter.
- Immunity will immediately be lost if any compete, acquire, or merge action is performed.
