- Enterprises will accumulate RP automatically over time.
- The base rate is +1 RP/day, accumulating fractionally every second.
  - E.g. after 12 hours an Enterprise will earn +0.5 RP
- An Enterprise will earn an extra +1 RP/day for every successful merger, and +2 RP/day for every successful acquisition.
- The max RP/day per Enterprise is +10. This may be increased at a later stage.
