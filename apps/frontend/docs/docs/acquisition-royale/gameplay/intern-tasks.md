# Intern Tasks

NOTE: Intern Tasks will be phased out and replaced by a new form of competitive minigame - coming soon.

- ~~Each day, anyone can claim 0.5 RP for free by completing ‘intern task’ transactions. No Enterprise or MATIC is required (except for gas costs).~~
- ~~This can be thought of as an RP faucet, allowing anyone to earn their way into purchasing an Enterprise, or earn some extra RP to help them complete RP-denominated actions or purchases even faster.~~
- ~~The 3 transactions can be seen as an anti-spam measure, mitigating against RP being dumped on secondary markets at a cost below the total gas cost of the 3 transactions.~~
