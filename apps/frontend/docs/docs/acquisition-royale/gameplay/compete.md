# Compete

- An Enterprise can spend RP to reduce the RP of another Enterprise.
- Reducing another Enterprise’s RP will make them more vulnerable to an acquisition, but by spending your RP you will also make your Enterprise more vulnerable.
- Generally, it only makes sense to Compete without Acquiring if the Enterprise you are attacking has a Moat.

### Dynamic Difficulty

- The RP cost of competing with other Enterprises will increase as the number of remaining Enterprises decreases:

  | Enterprises Remaining | Compete Cost (RP) |
