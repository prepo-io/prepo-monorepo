# Tokenomics

## Enterprises

- Transferable ERC-721 token (NFT) on Polygon

#### Distribution

- There are 15k Enterprises in total at the start of the game
- 9k are purchasable for MATIC
- 6k are reserved for game expansions (e.g. RP Shop), collaborations, influencers, contributors, competitions, and giveaways.

#### Deflationary Supply

- Every time a merge or acquisition occurs, the total number of Enterprises decreases, meaning surviving Enterprises will become rarer over time.
- The only way that the Enterprise count can increase is via [Revival](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/revive), but this can only happen a maximum of 100 times.

#### Utility

- A rare NFT collectible
- Ongoing accumulation of RP
- Integrations with prePO

## Runway Points (RP)

- Transferable ERC-20 token on Polygon

#### Utility

- Spend on game actions and [RP Shop](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/rp-shop) purchases
- Liquidate/trade for MATIC

#### Inflation

- Enterprises generate new RP every block.
- There is an RP/day limit per Enterprise (currently a max of +12 RP/day).
- If an Enterprise gets acquired or merged, it will no longer contribute to RP inflation. However, the upgraded Enterprise will earn more RP/day, which will offset the effect of there being less Enterprises unless they are at the RP/day limit.
- Enterprises that haven't been founded yet will not contribute towards inflation.
- During special events, global RP/day rates may be temporarily boosted.
- Treasury holds a reserve supply to allocate towards future gameplay expansions. If later deemed unnecessary, the reserve supply will be burnt.
- Note: the supply number on PolygonScan does not reflect reality, since RP is only actually minted as an ERC-20 when [withdrawn](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/withdraw-rp) from an Enterprise.

#### Deflation

- All RP spent on game actions and RP Shop purchases is burnt.
- All RP spent on game actions is burnt.
- 50% of RP withdrawn from an Enterprise is burnt.
- 30% of RP from combined balances after merging or acquiring is burnt.
- All RP spent on RP Shop purchases is burnt.
- All RP redeemed for MATIC is burnt.
- Deflationary effects become more significant in the late stages of the game due to [Dynamic Difficulty](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/compete#dynamic-difficulty), increasing prices for game actions, increasing prices for RP Shop items, and redemptions for MATIC requiring more RP.

#### Liquidity

- $50k of effective liquidity has been seeded in a concentrated range for the [RP/MATIC Uniswap V3 pool](/acquisition-royale/useful-links#trading-pools).

#### RP for MATIC

- In an upcoming update, RP will be redeemable directly for MATIC.
- The redeem rates are currently planned to be as follows (top to bottom, until allocations are exhausted):

  | RP Redeemable | MATIC per RP | MATIC Total |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 250 | 1 | 250 |
  | 500 | 0.5 | 250 |
  | 650 | 0.4 | 260 |
  | 800 | 0.3 | 240 |
  | 1000 | 0.2 | 1000 |
  | 10k | 0.1 | 1000 |
  | 20k | 0.05 | 1000 |
  | 40k | 0.025 | 1000 |
  | **= 73.2k RP** | - | **= 5k MATIC** |
  
- Initially, each address will be able to redeem up to 0.5 RP a day.

## Consumables

- Transferable ERC-1155 tokens on Polygon
- [Rename](/acquisition-royale/customization/rename)/[Rebrand](/acquisition-royale/customization/rebrand)/[Revive](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/revive) Tokens have a limited supply.
- Only 10k Rename Tokens, 1k Rebrand Tokens, and 100 Revive Tokens will ever be created.
- Every time one of these consumable tokens are used, the token is burnt. This means that these consumable tokens have a deflationary supply, and will become increasingly rare over time.
