# Rebrand

- Rebranding options will be available in the future.
- Consume a Rebrand Token to change your Enterprise's artwork to a supported variant.
- Rebrand Tokens can be purchased in the **RP Shop** for 10 RP, while supplies last.
- The default artwork is an Acquisition Royale stats card, which is fully on-chain and updates dynamically based on your Enterprise's latest stats.
  - Note: for the artwork to be updated on OpenSea, you will need to manually click the 'Refresh metadata' button on a particular Enterprise NFT's OpenSea page.
- Rebranding to a branding which you previously rebranded to has no cost.
- There will be bounties available for artists/developers to create sets of interpretive artwork variants for Enterprises which can be rebranded to once approved by the team/community.
