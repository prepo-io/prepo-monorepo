# FAQ

### What is an NFT?

NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token”, and basically it’s a unique digital item stored on the blockchain that can be owned and traded - for example, the Enterprises in Acquisition Royale!

### What is prePO?

**[prePO](https://prepo.io/)** is an upcoming decentralized trading platform allowing anyone, anywhere to gain exposure to the upside or downside of any pre-IPO company or pre-token crypto project.

### Why is prePO building an NFT game?

Gamification is core to the vision for the prePO platform, as it will make the trading experience more accessible and fun.

We not only wanted to create an engaging and experimental blockchain game that stands on its own, but also one that attracts users from various NFT and crypto gaming communities and gets them excited about the prePO platform.

### When does the game end?

The game never strictly ends; however, due to the [Dynamic Difficulty](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/compete#dynamic-difficulty) and [Moat](/acquisition-royale/gameplay/moats) mechanisms, it will become increasingly difficult for acquisitions to occur, so the supply of Enterprises is likely to stabilize at some number in the later stages of the game.

### How do I find other Enterprises to target?

For now, players are encouraged to hunt around on PolygonScan for those who have made [recent transactions](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa46afF3aB117b51f33dB178593552d0ca0B1365e) or via the [list of Enterprise holders](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xa46afF3aB117b51f33dB178593552d0ca0B1365e#balances). The targeted address or Enterprise token ID should then be inputted under "Competitor Analysis" on https://play.acquisitionroyale.com/ in order to compete against or acquire them.

### How will the proceeds be used?

5% of all proceeds will go towards [the most effective charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/best-charities-to-donate-to-2021/). The remainder of funds will be allocated towards bounties/grants, ongoing support for the game, future games, and the prePO platform.
