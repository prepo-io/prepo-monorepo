# Revive

- You can consume a Revive Token to take ownership of any burnt Enterprise in the state it was in before it was burnt (i.e. same RP/day, same id, same stats, same name, same unlocked brands, but always with 0 RP).
- Revive Tokens can be purchased in the **RP Shop** for 100 RP, while supplies last.
- You can revive any burnt Enterprise, even if you didn't previously own it.
- After revival, the revived Enterprise will have Immunity for 7 days. This Immunity will be lost immediately if it performs a compete, acquire, or merge action.
